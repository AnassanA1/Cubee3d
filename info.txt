raycasting :
    - each ray --->  - what it hits .
                     - how far away it (can determine wall height)
                     - where in the wall (texture).

the player representation in the map :
    - the player needs 3 things : - position in the map (x, y)
                                  - direction vector (the direction the player looking at (dirx, diry))
                                  - camera plane (simply camera screen defines the FOV 0,66 for human view)
